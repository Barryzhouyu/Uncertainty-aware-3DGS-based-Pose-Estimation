> This project builds upon the [variational 3DGS model](https://github.com/csrqli/variational-3dgs) developed by Ruiqi Li.
### 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation for our paper:

“Uncertainty-Aware Active Perception with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Robot Pose Estimation”

We propose a novel active perception pipeline that quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pose estimation and leverages them for uncertainty-aware path planning in robot navigation. Unlike prior 3DGS methods that focus on rendering or localization alone, our approach enables robots to identify informative viewpoints for re-observation—without requiring real-time localization.
