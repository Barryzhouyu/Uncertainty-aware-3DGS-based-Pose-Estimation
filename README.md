This project explores uncertainty-aware active perception for robot using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We integrate 3DGS-based pose estimation and information gain with robot motion dynamics to guide robots toward informative viewpoints under uncertainty, without real-time localization.

### Key Features
•	    3DGS-based pose estimation
•	    Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty quantification
•	    Information-gain driven path planning
•	    Simulation and validation in simulator and real-world environment

### Applications
•	    Uncertainty-aware robotic navigation
•	    Active data collection under limited sensing
