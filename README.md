This project builds upon the variational 3DGS model developed by Ruiqi Li.

### üìå Overview

This repository contains the implementation for our paper:

‚ÄúUncertainty-Aware Active Perception with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Robot Pose Estimation‚Äù

We propose a novel active perception pipeline that quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pose estimation and leverages them for uncertainty-aware path planning in robot navigation. Unlike prior 3DGS methods that focus on rendering or localization alone, our approach enables robots to identify informative viewpoints for re-observation‚Äîwithout requiring real-time localization.

### üîß Key Features
	‚Ä¢	3DGS-based Pose Estimation using image comparison and optimization.
	‚Ä¢	Aleatoric & Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation from predicted images and scene perturbations.
	‚Ä¢	Information-Gain Driven Path Planning for active perception in unknown environments.
	‚Ä¢	Validated in both simulation and underwater real-world experiments.

### üìÅ Modules
	‚Ä¢	variational-3dgs: Implementation of our uncertainty-aware Gaussian Splatting variant.
	‚Ä¢	Pose_wise_UQ: Code for estimating per-pose uncertainty using image sampling and PnP.
	‚Ä¢	3DGS_Dataset_Creation: Scripts to prepare datasets from real-world or simulated robot runs.

### üéØ Applications
	‚Ä¢	Uncertainty-aware visual pose estimation
	‚Ä¢	Active visual exploration under noisy or partial observations
	‚Ä¢	Underwater robotic navigation with limited localization
